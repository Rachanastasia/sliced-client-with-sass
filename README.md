## Codebase Structure

### /src/App.js

This is where the user context lives. This component renders the header, footer, and router.

### /src/components

All other react components are stored in this folder. Every parent component has its own folder, containing the component file, the test file, and--in most cases--a CSS file.

The folders for RecipeList and RecipePage also contains relavent child components.

#### /Routes

This folder contains the public and private routes used in src/Router.js, and a componenet that controls scrolling to top between routes.

### /src/services

This folder contains Javascript helper files that function in different ways.

#### /parse-input-service

Takes in a string from the user input and splits it into the propor data format based on regex and valid types.

#### /parse-amount-service

Parses the amount_str returned from parse-input-service, seperating the number from the unit.

#### /scale-service

Provides the scaling functionality in the component RecipePage.js

#### /capitalize-recipe-title-service

Turns recipe title to lower case and capitalizes the first letter of every word.

#### /user-recipe-api-services

Makes GET, POST, and DELETE requests to server.

#### /token-service

Gets, clears, and verifies auth token.

#### /auth-api-service
